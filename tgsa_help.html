<h6>Quick Start</h6>
Open a FITS image taken using the transmission grating spectrometer (TGS)
by selecting <i>File -&gt; Open</i> and choosing the file. Click on the
image to center the crosshair on the star in the image. Check that the red
selection box in the image is around the diffracted spectrum. Choose
<i>Image -&gt; Create Plot</i> to produce a spectrum plot.

<h6>Using FITS Images</h6>
Use the zoom options to study the image in detail to better position
the selection box. Detailed information about the image can be found
in the FITS header, which can be revealed by selecting
<i>Image -&gt; Show/Hide FITS Header</i>.
Compensate for rotation in the spectrum by using the tilt up/tilt down controls.
Wavelength accuracy in plots can be improved by comparing position of
emission/absorption lines to predicted values and fine-tuning the position
of the selection box in the image.

<h6>Modifying Plots</h6>
Appearance of plots, as well as plotting of spectral lines, can
be configured using the options in the <i>Plot</i> menu. Note:
modifying the median average width will alter the spectrum
data in the plot.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a name="saving">
<h6>Saving Data</h6>
Plots can be saved as PDF files by choosing <i>File -&gt; Save</i>.
Raw data from plots can be saved as simple comma-separated-value (CSV)
files by selecting <i>File -&gt; Export Data</i>.
</a>
</p>

<h6>Stitching Spectra</h6>
In order to compensate for blurring caused by the curved focal plane
of the transmission grating, several images can be taken at different
focus positions, plotted and combined. Produce spectrum plots of each
image in the set and select <i>Plot -&gt; Stitch Spectra..</i>. Select
the plots from the list on the left and click <i>Add</i> to append
them to the list of plots to combine. Plots will be combined in
the order in which they appear in the list on the right. You can enter
a comma-separated list of wavelengths at which to stich the spectra
together, or allow them to be split at even intervals. Press <i>OK</i>
to produce a combined plot.
